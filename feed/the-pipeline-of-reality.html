	<h1>the pipeline of reality</h1>
	
	<p>
Out there exists a universe where three clans reside: Team Flowerhead, Team Fountain and Team Waterballoon and each one of them wants access to this one infinite water supply - you just need to be connected to the pipeline to get water. Team Flowerhead thinks that the universe would look pretty if it was filled with flowers. Team Fountain is devoted to putting a water fountain or two in every street corner. And Team Waterballoon wants to maximize fun by creating an endless supply of water balloons. 
<br><br>
But tough luck. For hundreds of years, possession of the water supply has switched from clan to clan. They keep fighting off those in power, destroying the pipelines they’ve built to provide for their projects, gaining and losing domination of the water supply.
<br><br>
Now, it was the end of the year. Team Flowerhead had held a near monopoly over the water for nearly two years. But during the past four weeks, in an alliance with Team Waterballoon, Team Fountain managed to destroy the Flowerheads’ water pipes and construct fountains over all the remaining flowers. It had been an extremely destructive defeat for Team Flowerhead. Now that Team Fountain had gained dominance, they even shut down water from their former allies, the Waterballoons completely, and started building pipelines over their residences, too. Team Flowerhead and Waterballoon were in a total shortage of water at this moment in time. Though they started gaining back some of the water pipes again in the next couple of weeks.
<br><br>
Team Waterballoon was going through hard times. They enforced a daily minimum of pipes for every citizen to construct. After the war, they saw it necessary to raise the minimum from twenty to forty meters. Everyone who didn’t build at least forty meters of pipeline per day would be punished by the state. And so many weaker individuals, including diseased and elderly people, were condemned by the state. The leaders justified it by the ancient myth “Those who build the pipeline will be spared.”
<br><br>
It was a late night meeting in the department for strategy at Team Flowerhead. They were trying to figure out a way to gain possession of the main water supply again. All kinds of ideas were tossed around.
<br><br>
- Let’s start an alliance with Team Waterballoon. It’ll give us twice the power!
<br><br>
- No, too risky. Don’t you remember the last time we did business with them?
<br><br>
- That’s right. We should do a targeted attack at each of their fountains instead.
<br><br>
- But there are thousands of them already! We don’t have enough men.
<br><br>
The leading military commander stood up from his seat. “We do not have the resources for a large scale targeted attack. And even if we did, they would know to prepare their defensive forces everywhere if even one location detected impending threat. Our best option is to prepare a centralized strike near the main water supply, bringing down all of their pipelines.”
<br><br>
- And our pipelines! We can’t do it.
<br><br>
One of the eldest Flowerheads had been sitting in silence at the corner of the room. “H-hm”, comes out of his throat, and everyone turns to look at him. “I have followed the situation between all three clans for nearly a century. For dozens and dozens of times, the power has switched, pipelines toppled, and my friends died in the various battles. Once in every fifty to a hundred years, someone gets the idea to destroy the entire pipeline. The last time it happened, I was but a young child. It devastated our family, our whole community, not to mention the two other clans, too. All that for temporary dominance of some water supply. I think it would be about time to stop this constant war.”
<br><br>
- But they are taking the water from our flowers! They are a threat to our community.
<br><br>
The old man continued, “If you wish to partake in opinion wars, you are volunteering in real war. Yes it’s our heritage. Yes we have a right to our opinion. But why should our opinions matter? They think we are just as bad as we think of them. Everyone, close your eyes. Imagine yourself as a young member of the Waterballoon clan.” You could hear the room fill with doubting sighs. “For your entire childhood, you have heard from your parents, and everyone around you how important water balloons are. You have heard stories of your grandparents fighting for water balloon dominancy, their friends and family dying in the cruel hands of the enemy.”
<br><br>
- I would switch sides!
<br><br>
“Statistically, you wouldn’t. Which means we’re all taking part in tribalism based on mere birth location. The objective course of action here would be jumping in the shoes of both tribes. Then, to think of what would remain in your goals from now, to then.”
<br><br>
- Pipeline! We all want to create the pipeline!
<br><br>
- Yes, and yet we all keep destroying it.
<br><br>
The military commander starts speaking again: “Ok that’s enough of that touchy-feely talk. Do you realize that we have just lost our possession of the pipeline? All we can do is fight what belongs to us back.”
<br><br>
- He’s not wrong. Even if it would be nice to live in peace, let’s be realistic. If we don’t defend ourselves, we’ll be crushed to the ground, like we just were. There’s no choice but to fight.
<br><br>
The old man started speaking again: “The reason they fight us, is because we are threatening their opinions - we’re in a disagreement, in a constant argument of why our opinions are better than theirs. Doing that leads to no conclusion. But if we started working on our common goal - building the pipeline - they would have no reason to fight us. We don’t have to pursue our opinions now. Let’s work for the common benefits.”
<br><br>
And as the following morning came, the Flowerheads started marching towards the pipelines of Team Fountain. The Fountainers saw them coming, and people asked their military leaders: “Should we get into defense positions now?”
<br><br>
“They have no weapons. We must wait,” he answered.
<br><br>
- They’re taking over the East side pipes! Do we fight?
<br><br>
- Not yet. They’ve destroyed nothing, nor have they planted any flowers yet.
<br><br>
The atmosphere in the camp started to tense up. No-one at Team Fountain was happy about the Flowerheads being on their grounds.
<br><br>
- Can we attack already?
<br><br>
“I will grant you permission to attack the very moment they plant a single flower,” the leader of Team Fountain’s military said.
<br><br>
Three days passed, and not a single flower was planted. Team Flowerhead had built a staggering five kilometers of pipeline. It was twice what Team Fountain had built in that time, and considering that the Fountainers had a great majority of all piping, and more men, even they had to admit that Team Flowerhead was onto something. “If we stop giving a shit about our opinions, and just pursue what we all value, we’ll make a lot more progress in the same amount of time,” someone proposed in the next strategy meeting of Team Fountain.
<br><br>
And as the next week came, Team Fountain took down all of their water fountains, and replaced them with more pipes. Progress increased by a tenfold.
<br><br>
Team Waterballoon was still hanging onto the small amount of balloon filling stations and pipelines they had. There were some among them who wished the team would follow lead with the two other clans.
<br><br>
- We’re not moving forward. Let’s stop our decay, and join the ever-increasing progress!
<br><br>
“No,” the leaders said. “We’re not giving up the rest of what we have left.”
<br><br>
- We could make a hundred times the water balloons we’re making now with the pipelines built by the two other clans already.
<br><br>
- Even if they have a hundred times the pipes, I see balloons here, and none there. We’ll fight to the end for what we have. Only five weeks ago they cut water from us and destroyed most of our stations.
<br><br>
- And now they’ve sacrificed even their own statues. Our fathers didn’t tell us to fill water balloons with our bare hands. They told us to create the most water balloons, period. Do you realize that if we did what the two other clans are doing, in a few centuries we could make millions more water balloons as now?
<br><br>
The leaders wouldn’t stir. Some members of the Waterballoon clan started fleeing from their camps. They had a mission. A mission to create the most water balloons. Filling and sealing the most balloons with their own hands wasn’t what they wanted. They wanted to do the actions that would lead to the maximum number of water balloons being made in the entire universe. But the leaders, blinded by dogma and power -they couldn’t see past their faulty logic and ineffective traditional ways.
<br><br>
In the universe lives this species, the cloggers. Their goal is to create the most happy cloggers in the world. They like being in water. However, they are such simple creatures, that they will occupy any source of water they find, not realizing it might kill and prevent other cloggers from being soaked. And sometimes they find their way into the main water supply, destroying all built pipelines, for the leisure of just one clogger, who doesn’t even understand what his actions have entailed.  On average, every 10 000 years, the cloggers manage to destroy the entire pipeline, centuries of work, in one evening. Thus, everyone thinks of them as pests. And so the old man of the Flowerhead clan is asked:
<br><br>
“Are the cloggers still pests? I bet you couldn’t explain to them not to clog up the pipeline, but isn’t their goal still as important as everyone else’s?”
<br><br>
“It sure is,” he answers. “There is just a little problem with their ability and understanding. Cloggers are such simple systems, that they’re unable to find the logical course of action. If they just had the knowledge, they would realize that did they leave the pipes untouched, we would build much more of them, being able to support even more cloggers. But they are too simple. Did you hear of the Waterballoon leaders? They wouldn’t let go of the water balloons they had, and so they went down with a systems failure at their own pressure regulation center, which brought down most of the few pipelines they still had. We’re now giving accommodation to everyone who left their camps. There’s an old myth that says ‘Those who build the pipeline will be spared.’ Only now does it make sense. It didn’t mean that we should kill everyone we don’t see building. It means means that if you don’t seek the greatest pipeline, you will sooner or later become your own doom.”
<br><br>
After the fall of the Waterballoon clan, the remaining people formed the New Waterballoon Group. Strategy meetings of war turned into pipeline strategy meetings between all three teams. The first ever strategy meeting like this was held soon after. But this was also a time for unification. For realising how similar everyone’s goals were after all. Several members of the public spoke at the gathering, including the old Flowerhead who had started this rapid change. Then, representatives from all three clans spoke, with the former military commander of the Fountain clan finishing:
<br><br>
“Thanks to the benign invasion of our regions by the Flowerhead clan, our progress on the pipeline project has increased by fifty times since then already. We can now see, that as impressive as peeing statues look, they don’t build upon themselves. The pipeline does. Thus we shall put our collective effort into the pipeline project from now on, in the interest of all three clans. Let’s work for a pipe-filled future together!”

<p>
In our universe, the situation isn’t quite as simple. There are plenty of different things to do to please everyone. It’s not one pipeline or stairway to heaven we should start building. Rather, this common goal consists of actions categorized under many different labels in our society, including research, education, engineering, and mainly hard work -but it's still one goal that encapsulates what is valuable in all of these.
<br><br>
If we don’t put in the effort, we’ll immediately stray from the path to success. But unlike the utopias suggested in the past, we’re not looking for a stationary end, a paradise. Every society like that is a dystopia in my eyes -and is from the perspective of the Ultimate Goal. Being short of progress and improvement is a suicide on the universal scale. Progress is key. Enjoy the process. The only thing we’re fighting, is entropy. And yet, we’re giving even entropy exactly what it wants. The pipeline of reality is the Ultimate Goal. Let’s build it together.
